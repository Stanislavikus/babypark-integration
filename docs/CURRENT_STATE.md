## Viber gateway

Production release:
`/opt/babypark-integration/releases/20260924-1809c564`

Current symlink:
`/opt/babypark-integration/current`

Production code:
`/opt/babypark-integration/current/src/gateway/index.mjs`

Systemd:
`babypark-integration-v2.service`

Boot state:
- v2: enabled + active
- legacy `babypark-integration.service`: disabled + inactive, retained for manual rollback

Data:
`/var/lib/babypark-integration/bridge.sqlite`

Bridge schema:
`PRAGMA user_version = 2`

Environment:
`/etc/babypark-integration.env`
(secret values are NOT in Git)

Local listener:
`127.0.0.1:3102`

Health:
`GET /health`

Public routes:
- `POST /api/viber/webhook`
- `POST /api/chatwoot/viber`

Nginx routes both public endpoints to port 3102.

Safe public-route verification:
- 2026-09-24: invalid Viber signature -> HTTP 401
- 2026-09-24: invalid Chatwoot signature -> HTTP 401
- 2026-09-26 after CatalogService deployment: both invalid-signature checks still -> HTTP 401
- gateway process was not restarted during CatalogService deployment
- `/opt/babypark-integration/current` remained on the 20260924 Viber release

Production bridge integrity after migration:
`PRAGMA integrity_check = ok`

Current row-count baseline immediately after cutover:
- sessions: 1
- processed_viber: 1
- processed_chatwoot: 2
- outgoing_viber: 1
- session_recovery_issues: 0

## CatalogService production

D1 deployment completed on 2026-09-26.

Merged deployment source:
`1956aba235f1771262235881701186cbc5bd884d`

Production release:
`/opt/babypark-integration/releases/20260926T205420Z-1956aba`

Catalog release symlink:
`/opt/babypark-integration/catalog-current`

Systemd:
`babypark-catalog-ingest.service`

Runtime state:
- enabled + active
- service identity: `babypark-catalog`
- local listener: `127.0.0.1:8081`
- observed idle RSS after enable: about 20 MiB
- `CATALOG_INGEST_ENABLED=true`

Durable state:
- parent: `/var/lib/babypark-catalog`
- owner: `babypark-catalog:babypark-catalog`
- mode: `0700`
- identity: `/var/lib/babypark-catalog/identity.sqlite`
- replay: `/var/lib/babypark-catalog/replay.sqlite`

Current authenticated state:
- schema: `bp.catalog.state/1`
- state: `BOOTSTRAP`
- accepting_ingest: `true`
- blockers: `[]`
- current_generation: `null`
- accepted_run: `null`

No Drupal FULL has been sent yet.

Recovery:
- authority: `BOOTSTRAP`
- identity revision: `0`
- replay schema: `7`
- covering recovery set: `set-20260926T205746Z-35f3395efc6f8994`
- coverage: `COVERED`
- BOOTSTRAP `validate-restore`: PASS

Public Catalog ingress on `https://chat.babypark.ua`:
- `/api/catalog/ingest/v1/full`
- `/api/catalog/ingest/v1/state`

Ingress controls:
- Nginx exact locations only
- source allowlist: Drupal outbound IP `77.83.102.249`
- BP1 authentication remains mandatory
- Catalog `/health` is not exposed by a Catalog-specific public route
- public `https://chat.babypark.ua/health` remains Chatwoot and returns `{"status":"woot"}`

Production ingress verification on 2026-09-26:
- allowed Drupal host + unsigned Catalog state request -> HTTP 401 `AUTH_FAILED`
- different BabyPark host + same request -> HTTP 403 from Nginx
- `nginx -t` -> PASS
- Chatwoot root -> HTTP 200
- Chatwoot public health -> `{"status":"woot"}`

## Rollback assets

Legacy Viber runtime remains:
`/opt/babypark-integration/index.mjs`

Legacy Viber unit remains installed:
`babypark-integration.service`

Pre-v2 standalone bridge backup:
`/var/backups/babypark-integration/bridge.pre-v2.20260924T062925Z.sqlite`

Backup SHA-256:
`d3f63edc60bdaa2a1af6f3b4cdeba3c17924be47293923b9d8efbd52136f7509`

Pre-v2 Nginx snapshot:
`/var/backups/babypark-integration/nginx_chatwoot.pre-v2.20260924T062925Z.conf`

D1 pre-Catalog-ingress Nginx snapshot:
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx_chatwoot.conf.bak.20260926T205920Z`

Normal Viber rollback does NOT restore the old database backup after v2 has accepted traffic.
The additive schema is intentionally compatible with the retained legacy gateway.

Catalog application rollback and catalog data/recovery rollback are separate operations.
Before the first FULL, `/var/lib/babypark-catalog` is preserved for diagnosis rather than
deleted automatically.

## Catalog / AI next state

No Drupal catalog exporter is active.
No AI copilot is active.

The canonical CatalogService is now deployed and ready to accept a future authenticated FULL.
The next slice is the read-only Drupal exporter/preflight/spool path.

No Drupal writes are required.
